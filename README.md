# Building Footprint Generation 
Building footprint generation is a complex task where we have to accuratlety predict the Building polygon from a given satellite RGB-PAN sharpen image.There has been numerous of papers and models availbale to do this task but still we have seen lot of irregularities in various models available.

# Objective
The objective of the repo is to create an inhouse AI model with the help availble polygon data of buildings from database available either as opensource like MSFT or OSM or internal Ttom database. 
The repository helps in creating data and an AI model for predicting building polygons on satellite RGB images from given geojson file either from MSFT/OSM/TTom.
